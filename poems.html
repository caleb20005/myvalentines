In your kindness, I find peace,

The joy you bring into my life,
Through laughter and through tears,
You've been there through it all.

A friend like you is rare,
A gift I cherish more each day,
Thank you for being you,
In every single way.</p>

You bring back hope, you bring back song.
You stand beside me, calm and true,
Life feels more gentle because of you.</p>

Like sunlight through the coldest days.
No grand display, no loud acclaim,
Just steady love that stays the same.</p>

They lift the dark, they hold the light.
In every room, in every view,
I am grateful life gave me you.</p>

 <div class="poem-card">
 <div class="poem-title">Simple Joy</div>
 <p class="poem-lines">A laugh we share, a little talk,
A memory made on an evening walk.
The sweetest gifts are often small,
Yet friendship makes them best of all.</p>

 <div class="poem-title">Safe Place</div>
 <p class="poem-lines">In storms of doubt, in restless night,
Your words can set my spirit right.

The kind of friend I asked for more.</p>

You color all my darkest gray.</p>

 <div class="poem-title">Near or Far</div>

Friendship still keeps its steady place.
Near or far, both old and new,
My heart still finds its way to you.</p>

In silent ways you help me stand,
With patient heart and open hand.</p>

But you are one made true to last.
A cherished light, a faithful view,
I am so lucky knowing you.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="poem-card">
 <div class="poem-title">Warm Light</div>

Your care is warm, your kindness meets
The tired parts I hide from view,
Then turns them bright with something true.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="poem-card">
 <div class="poem-title">True Companion</div>

Not rushing steps, not losing pace.
Through joy and tears, through what we do,
I trust this road because of you.</p>

 <div class="poem-title">Little Moments</div>
 <p class="poem-lines">We build a life from little things,
From talks and smiles and what each day brings.
Those little moments, bright and new,
Are now my favorites, thanks to you.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="poem-card">
 <div class="poem-title">Thank You Note</div>

A field of thanks from start to end.
For all your care, for all you do,
This simple note says I treasure you.</p>

 <div class="poem-card">
 <div class="poem-title">Steady Star</div>

A gentle strength in all you do,
The world is better made by you.</p>

Forever, I am thankful for you.</p>

The future brighter, never fear.
